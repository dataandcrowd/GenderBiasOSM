## Our Main Findings
- No.of Contributed Countries: Women were remarkably lower than that of men
- However, such variabilities was identified by the disaggregation of gender and age
    * Men between 20s-50s & Women in 20s
- Men were more likely to be spatial diverse than their female counterparts: **M: .67, W: .50**
- However, this once again varied significantly by the age groups.

### Why are We Doing This Research?
#### Crowdsourced Data: Patchy Distribution Across Space & Time
* A well-known feature of the data from citizen science projects is the patchy distribution of maps across space and time
* This leaves global citizen science datasets with spatial and temporal gaps and redundancies

#### Understanding the crowd's temporal patterns and their spatial preferences is imperative 
* Contributors' daily volunteering routines and preferences can reveal habits and interests
* Can assist app designers and software engineers to create more inclusive crowdsourcing platforms

### Exploratory Findings | Top three countries accounted for 60% of the total contribution

- Long-tail distribution: Men and women in 20s
- Women > 30s: Fewer than 100 contributed countries
- **Oversampling?**: OSM, in general, might have a similar distribution

### Simpson's Index of Diversity: The Metrics

#### Probability that any two randomly selected countries from the sample will be different

[$D' = 1 - (\sum n(n-1)/N(N-1))$]{style="font-size:20px"}

-   **N**: Total number of contributions (by user)
-   **n**: Number of contributions at particular country (by user)
-   Defined at individual level and then aggregated by gender and age

#### How should I understand the numbers?

-   0: Low diversity (tends to be domestic)
-   1: High diversity

#### Simpson's Index of Diversity: Quick Example

#### Figures
![](images/density.png){.absolute top="150" left="-30" width="500" height="480"}

- SID: Female: 0.50 Male: 0.67
- Male participants were likely contribute to more countries than their female counterparts.
- However, two peaks of diversity patterns of the female users mean that the spatial preference within the group contrasts significantly


![](images/boxplotage.png){.absolute top="100" left="-30" width="500" height="480"}

- Male participants have systematically scored higher diversity measures across both age groups
- The scores of female participants are constantly lower than that of males, and it <span style="color:blue">*varies significantly by age groups*</span>
- Female 40-50s’ have wider variation due to small number of participants
